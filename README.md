### How To Customize JInstall
Open up file explorer and head to the directory C:\Windows\tracing, here there will be a file called "JInstall.json", open that file up with a text editor.
There will be words (such as Install Directory) and then options/words sitting next to it (such as C:/windows/tracing/JInstall). Lets say your goal is to edit the directory in which programs are installed to. Lets just change the option seated next to Install Directory, in which the default option is C:/windows/tracing/JInstall. Change the C:/windows/tracing//JInstall to the directory you want it to install to. For example I want it to download to my scripts folder, so I would change it to C:/Scripts
